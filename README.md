## Problem
In today's digital world, verifying educational credentials is often slow, expensive, and prone to fraud. Employers, institutions, and individuals struggle with:

- **Credential Fraud** Fake diplomas and certificates are easily created and hard to detect.
- **Verification Delays** Traditional verification processes can take days or weeks.
- **Data Tampering** Paper and centralized digital records are vulnerable to loss, forgery, or unauthorized changes.
- **Lack of Ownership** Graduates have little control over their own credentials and often rely on third parties for access

## Solution
We use Blockchain-based Soulbound Tokens (BSTs) as non-transferable 
NFTs to securely link educational credentials to their rightful owners. 
This ensures that certificates cannot be forged, transferred, or lost, 
providing a verifiable, tamper-proof, and permanent record of academic 
achievements. With instant on-chain verification, institutions, employers,
and individuals can seamlessly confirm credentials without relying on intermediaries
